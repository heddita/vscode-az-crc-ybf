Hi, I'm trying to replicate the Azure Cloud Resume Challenge once more, for practice.  This time to change it up just a bit, I'm doing this one for my wife.

## First Steps
 -- I've added the HTML front end, modified the info and added the counter.js in the css folder.
 -- I've created the backend structure up to add the python script for the function.
